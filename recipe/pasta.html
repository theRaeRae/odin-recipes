        <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>Is there anything better than a bowl of steamy, cheesy, meaty pasta put in front of your face on a cold winter night? Or any night, really? This one hits all the right notes: tender pasta, spicy sausage, earthy mushrooms, salty parmesan, and a creamy, garlicky sauce all in one dish. Plenty of sausage pasta for you, less dishes to clean up.</p>

            <p>I know sometimes pasta gets a bad rap, but it’s honestly no worse for you than eating two pieces of bread on a sandwich, so long as your bowl (and that sandwich) aren’t gigantically oversized. Everything in moderation, right? </p>

        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        
            <h3>How long do you cook the sausage?</h3>
                <p>Ground sausage only takes about 6-8 minutes over medium-high heat to cook through. If you’ve purchased sausage in the casings, you can easily cut the meat out of the casing before cooking and it will crumble up nicely. </p>

                <p>You’ll want to either take the sausage out of the pan with a slotted spoon if you are going to use the grease in a skillet for cooking something else, or you should drain the sausage and dump the excess fat in the skillet if you need to start clean. </p>
            
            <h3>What temperature should you cook Hungarian sausages?</h3>

                <p>If you are cooking sausage links, you should place raw, thawed links onto a greased baking sheet or lined with parchment or another oven-safe liner. Place them about an inch apart and bake in the oven at 350 degrees for 15-18 minutes, flipping over once at the halfway mark. If you’re not sure if they are done cooking, use a meat thermometer to check for doneness. It should read 160 degrees for fully cooked sausage. That’s the perfect way to cook Hungarian sausage for this pasta sausage white sauce recipe.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups of pasta of your choice</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of olive oil</li>

            <li>2 tablespoon of butter</li>
            <li>3 teaspoon of minced garlic</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of sliced mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 cup of chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 cup of heavy cream</li>
            <li>Cracked black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>PArmesan, parsley, thyme, and chili flakes (Optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a deep skillet, or pot, bring 4 cups water to a boil. Stir in penne noodles along with 1 teaspoon salt. Boil 6-9 minutes until fork-tender. Drain, toss with 1 teaspoon oil, and set aside.</li>
            <li>In the same skillet you used for the pasta (or a new one if you used a pot) cook sausage over medium-high heat, breaking up with a spoon or spatula as it cooks, for 6-8 minutes or until completely browned. Use a slotted spoon to transfer to a bowl and cover to keep warm.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium and add butter to the pan. Once melted, stir in garlic 1-2 minutes til fragrant. Add mushrooms and saute 3-4 minutes until very tender.</li>
            <li>Stir in chicken broth and heavy cream and simmer over medium-low heat until reduced (about 5-10 minutes).</li>
            <li>Stir in cooked sausage and noodles. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Top with parmesan and parsley or thyme if desired and serve.</li>
        </ol>
