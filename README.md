# odin-recipes
Set up your README.md file and write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.)

This project is a website for some of my favorite Filipino recipes and some international cuisines
The skills I'll demenstrate are the things I've learned in the Html section of the Odin Project
